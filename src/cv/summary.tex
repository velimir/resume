Experienced pastry commis chef with expertise in classic French patisserie and contemporary pastry trends. Proficient in working with shortcrust, sweet, choux, and puff pastry, as well as various sponges such as emmanuel, pain de gÃªnes, dacquoise, and melindro. Skilled in creating mousses, layered cakes, tarts, and finishing techniques including mirror glaze, velvet finishing, and chocolate work. Passionate about discovering new trends in pastry and continuously improving my craft since I began studying patisserie in 2016.
